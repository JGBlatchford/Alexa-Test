# Project IoT
Open source, Arduino hobby IoT project using Particle.io Photons,
Alexa, and iOS apps.

Refer to my blog at lisles.net for more information.
All this code is running in my RV, but is a work-in-progress.
It may take me awhile to get it all posted in this Github repo.
I ask for your indulgence in allowing me time to get
all the pieces uploaded here.

This project is intended to help other hobbyist that want to create
their own Arduino IoT devices, but may not want to create their own
Alexa or iOS apps to control them.

## Devices
Particle.io Photons are used to due to their ease of use and great
support. I've created low cost printed circuit boards (PCBs) to make
it even easier to use. These have wireless built-in, and can be programmed
over-the-air (OTA) so all they need is power to get started.

I've provided a set of source code files and instructions
that can be used to simplify
programming IoT devices using Particle's $19 Photon.

I've also include the Eagle files and instructions for creating
general purpose IoT printed circuit boards. Using these files,
PCBs can be ordered from China for about $1.50 each.

## Alexa Skill
An Alexa skill can be used to voice control the devices.
This includes Amazon's Echo, Dot, or Tap, in addition to other
AVS implementations such as Astra running on iOS.

## iOS Apps
An iOS app can be used to control devices from your iPhone or iPad.

In addition, I've created a separate iOS app that can run on older
iOS devices. I use this to provide control panels by mounting unused,
older iPhones directly to the wall in various places around my RV.
